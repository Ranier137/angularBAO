# Cosmological Analysis from Angular BAO data

Likelihood for cosmological analysis of angular BAO


The files .py (Angular_BAO.py, ...) sample a markov chain assuming the flat $\Lambda$ CDM as the theoretical model, exploring the parametric space {rd*h,Om} or {rd,H0,Om}.

The data (the angular BAO measured) and its covariance matrix are avaiable in the directory ....


There are three types of analysis.

## Angular BAO:
